# SECTION 1: Metacharacters
# Metacharacters are what make regular expressions more powerful than normal string methods.
# They allow you to create regular expressions to represent concepts like "one or more repetitions of a vowel".

# The existence of metacharacters poses a problem if you want to create a regular expression (or regex) that matches a literal metacharacter, such as "$". 
# You can do this by escaping the metacharacters by putting a backslash in front of them.
# However, this can cause problems, since backslashes also have an escaping function in normal Python strings. 
# This can mean putting three or four backslashes in a row to do all the escaping.
# To avoid this, you can use a raw string, which is a normal string with an "r" in front of it. We saw usage of raw strings in the previous lesson.
