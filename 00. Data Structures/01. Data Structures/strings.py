# Strings
# Strings are used to store text, and are one of the simplest and most used data structures.
# Any text between two single or double quotation marks is a string.

# For example: The variable x now represents a string.
x = "Hello world"
print(x)


# There are a number of special characters that can be used in strings. \n represents a new line:
print('One \nTwo \nThree')



# Similarly, \t represents a tab.
# If you want to include a single quote in a single-quoted string (or a double quote in a double-quoted string), 
# you need to escape it using a backslash:
print('Brian\'s mother: He\'s not an angel. He\'s a very naughty boy!')

# The backslash is also called the escape character.


# Special Characters: How many lines does this code output?
print("1\n2\n345\n6")   #output: 4
