Almost every program uses data.
Organizing, managing and storing data is important as it enables easier access and efficient modifications.

Data Structures allow you to store and manage your data.

Python has a number of built-in data structures:
- Strings
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Tuples
- Sets

During this course, we will learn about these data structures, use them to store data and see their real-life applications.

If you are not familiar with the basics of Python, please complete our Python for Beginners course first.


In addition to the built-in data structures, 
Python allows you to create your own data structures, enabling you to have full control over their functionality.

The most prominent data structures are:
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Linked Lists
These data structures have many uses in popular algorithms. We will learn about them in the coming modules.
