# SECTION 1
# Object-orientation is very useful when managing different objects and their relations. 
# That is especially useful when you are developing games with different characters and features.

# Let's look at an example project that shows how classes are used in game development.
# The game to be developed is an old fashioned text-based adventure game.
# Below is the function handling input and simple parsing.
def get_input():
  command = input(": ").split()
  verb_word = command[0]
  if verb_word in verb_dict:
    verb = verb_dict[verb_word]
  else:
    print("Unknown verb {}". format(verb_word))
    return

  if len(command) >= 2:
    noun_word = command[1]
    print (verb(noun_word))
  else:
    print(verb("nothing"))

def say(noun):
  return 'You said "{}"'.format(noun)

verb_dict = {
  "say": say,
}

while True:
  get_input()
#

# The code above takes input from the user, and tries to match the first word with a command in verb_dict. 
# If a match is found, the corresponding function is called.

# (1): def get_input(): command = input(": ").split() verb_word = command[0] 
# if verb_word in verb_dict: verb = verb_dict[verb_word] else: print("Unknown verb {}".format(verb_word)) return 
# if len(command) >= 2: noun_word = command[1] print(verb(noun_word)) else: print(verb("nothing")) 
# def say(noun): return 'You said "{}"'.format(noun) verb_dict = { "say": say, } while True: get_input() 
# OUTPUT: >>> : say Hello! You said "Hello!" : say Goodbye! You said "Goodbye!" :test Unknown verb test
# (2): Thanks to the reply of Jonathon McEwan to the question comment of Egildio Nham, 
# I luckily managed to figure out that the verb_dict is a dictionary that's DEFINED towards the BOTTOM of the code!!! 
# Admittedly, with this whole OOP module, reading code from bottom to top instead can awkwardly help a lot sometimes. 
# Last code block of the example code is the following. 
# while True: get_input() The while True bit indicates that there will NEVER ever be an END to the repeated execution of the code get_input(). 
# An infinite loop I think this gets called. That's why trying the code out, you would be REPEATEDLY prompted for user input really. 
# Hence why in the OUTPUT that's shown, though there's ">>>" at the beginning of the OUTPUT, it's not there at the end, 
# since there's no actual end to the infinite loop, it goes on FOREVER.
# (3): Now, let's go through what you see in the OUTPUT they've got there. 
# Program starts up, and aside from the bunch of 2 function definitions, the dictionary assignment of verb_dict, 
# you've got the following code which is what causes something to ultimately be OUTPUT. while True: get_input() 
# So, the code (the function I mean) get_input() gets executed. 
# Now, consider how this get_input() function is DEFINED. def get_input(): command = input(": ").split() 
# User gets prompted to enter input right after ": " on the OUTPUT screen. User enters say Hello!, and so input(": ") is taken as the string "say Hello!". 
# So, I presume the following interpretations
# (4): command = input(": ").split() command = "say Hello!".split() 
# Now, plz see the PIC on the following link to quickly remind yourself of the split method, and what it means to have nothing inside the parenthesis () of split(). 
# https://pythonproject.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/split_method.jpg 
# Hence, command variable is assigned to be equal to a LIST of 2 strings. That's it. command = ["say", "Hello!"] 
# Then, you've got the following. verb_word = command[0] 
# So, verb_word variable is assigned to be equal to the index 0 element of the list called command, which is the string "say". Therefore,
# (5): verb_word = "say" Look at the BOTTOM of the example code now. 
# See how verb_dict = {"say": say}, so verb_dict really refers to a dictionary, with just a single element really, namely the Key:Value element given by "say": say. 
# OK, next consider the following code line, which gets interpreted presumably as follows. 
# if verb_word in verb_dict: verb = verb_dict[verb_word] if "say" in {"say": say}: verb = verb_dict[verb_word] Of course, "say" refers to the Key "say", since in a dictionary, 
# though the there may be one or more Values being the EXACT SAME Values, all Keys MUST be DISTINCT, 
# and because of this, we identify any specific element of a dictionary by its Key.
# (6): The key "say" certainly exists in the dictionary {"say": say}, so really the first line of the 2 line code block becomes "if True:", 
# and so the 2nd line of code gets executed for sure. 
# verb = verb_dict[verb_word] We know verb_dict={"say": say} and that verb_word = "say", hence verb = say Also, recall that command=["say", "Hello!"]. 
# Clearly, this has got 2 elements and so has a length of 2. Thus, len(command) = 2. if len(command) >= 2: noun_word = command[1] print(verb(noun_word))          
# (7): Since, len(command) ≥ 2 holds True, the 2 lines indented code block is surely executed. 
# I suppose the following interpretations get made. Remember command[1] refers to the index 1 element of the LIST assigned to command, 
# and that verb = say noun_word = command[1] print(verb(noun_word)) noun_word = "Hello!" print(say("Hello!")) 
# This is just saying that apply the function say on the string "Hello!", 
# and then whatever gets RETURNED by the function, that you print right away. 
# So, now you look at the way the say function is DEFINED, which you find if you look at what come after the definition of the get_input() function.
# (8): def say(noun): return 'You said "{}"'.format(noun) 
# I think the following interpretations get made. say("Hello!") RETURN 'You said "{}"'.format("Hello!") say("Hello!") RETURN 'You said "Hello!"' 
# So, print(say("Hello!")) would print You said "Hello!" to OUTPUT
# https://pythonproject.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/split_method.jpg   # reminder regarding the SPLIT method

# There are a few things that I didn't quite much get... 
# First thing is: print(verb(noun_word)) verb is a variable... not a function ! But even if it was... 
# how does this work ? I am really confused ! Second thing is: def say(noun): return 'You said "{}"'.format(noun) 

# The code takes the user input: say hello And using split makes it an array consisting of 'say' and 'hello' both assigned to the variable 'command' 
# command = ["say","hello"] verb_dict is referring to a dictionary declared near the bottom. 
# The key value pair here is Key: say Value: say(noun) Which is assigned to the variable verb noun_word=command[1] 
# So when print(verb(noun_word)) is called its actually calling say("hello")


# What does the split method called on the input do?  -- Divides the input into separate words
# https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/dictionary/python-split
# https://pythonproject.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/split_method.jpg
# "Split" separate the words from space between them and put them into a list.  

# Split a string into a list where each word is a list item: 
txt = "welcome to the jungle" 
x = txt.split() 
print(x) # ['welcome', 'to', 'the', 'jungle']


# SECTION 2
# A Simple Game
# The next step is to use classes to represent game objects.

  class_name = ""

    # with the key ”Goblin” (the name of the class to which that instance belongs to, its inherited attribute class_name). 
    # Problem is, I think, you cannot instantiate more than one Goblin as the map won't admit more than one ”Goblin” key. 
    # The code is horrible,, and not only this, and though it's just trying to show some things, it should note which are not the way of doing things. 
    # they could even point that those if could be a mapping through a map, 
    # one line of code and as many different messages as you want just adding them to the map, 
    # which is as clear to read even could be given to non-programmers to mantain, translate, ... being read from a plain text file.

  class_name = "goblin"

goblin = Goblin("Gobbly")

#

# We created a Goblin class, which inherits from the GameObjects class.

# Explanation of GameObject.objects[self.class_name]=self : 
# When goblin object(of class Goblin) is created, __init__ method gets called(as Goblin is inherited from GameObject class) Self is nothing but name of the object. 
# so, goblin.name=Gobbly LHS =GameObject.objects[self.class_name] 
# self is nothing but object name = GameObject.objects[goblin.class_name] 
# replaced self word with goblin = GameObject.objects[goblin] 
#  goblin.class_name means we are referencing Goblin class through its object goblin. goblin.class_name=goblin RHS = self = goblin
# as said, self is object name Hence, GameObject.objects[goblin]=goblin. This made the dictionary objects = {"goblin" : goblin}

# objects = {} # creates a dictonary in the class "GameObject" To have access to the dictionary, the code is: "GameObject.objects" ... 
# In fact, if you digit this code, you will have an empty brackets >>> GameObject.objects {} There are no elements in it. 
# With the next code you create a key “elf” with a value elf (notice that elf is the label of an object) 
# GameObject.objects["elf"] = elf to do so in the class in a generic way (for every istance you will create later), 
# there is that line: GameObject.objects[self.class_name] = self 
# So let's see the key first: 
# self.class_name self is the name of the istance you create (goblin in the code) class_name is the string "goblin" created when the istance is created 
# The instance is > goblin = Goblin("Gobbly") goblin is the istance made using the blueprint of Goblin 
# Goblin (the class) creates 2 attributes of goblin (the instance) one of this is the class_name = "goblin"

You said "Hello!" : examine goblin goblin A foul creature : examine elf There is no elf here. : 
(3): Let's go through the OUTPUT. First block was already covered in last lesson. So, I'll go through the second block of OUTPUT. I suppose the following interpretations get made. command = input(": ").split() command = "examine goblin".split() command = ["examine", "goblin"] verb_word = command[0] verb_word = "examine" if verb_word in verb_dict: verb = verb_dict[verb_word] Remember that verb_dict ={"say": say, "examine": examine}. Hence if True: verb = verb_dict["examine"] verb = verb_dict["examine"] verb = examine                              
(4): if len(command) ≥ 2: noun_word = command[1] print(verb(noun_word)) Remember that command = ["examine", "goblin"], so command had 2 elements, and hence its length is 2. if True: noun_word = "goblin" print(examine("goblin")) So, all that gets executed is really just the following. print(examine("goblin")) So, let's figure out what gets RETURNED by the code examine("goblin") def examine(noun): if noun in GameObject.objects: return GameObject.objects[noun].get_desc def examine("goblin"): if "goblin" in GameObject.objects: return GameObject.objects["goblin"].get_desc
(5): Now, consider the following code. class GameObject: class_name = "" desc = "" objects = {} def __init__(self, name): self.name = name GameObject.objects[self.class_name] = self def get_desc(self): return self.class_name + "\n" + self.desc class Goblin(GameObject): class_name = "goblin" desc = "A foul creature" goblin = Goblin("Gobbly") The class Goblin INHERITS from the class GameObject. Hence, the class methods, attributes and variable of class GameObject get "copied and pasted" onto the class Goblin. But bare in mind that the variable class_name of the class Goblin gets re-assigned to the string "goblin" from the (empty) string "". Also, the variable desc gets re-assigned to the string "A foul creature" from the (empty) string "".
(6): An instance, named goblin (= self), of the Goblin class gets created, with its name-attribute equal to the string "Gobbly". So, goblin.name = "Gobbly". Remember GameObject.objects = {}, an empty DICTIONARY. Consider what goblin.class_name is equal to. Also, since the goblin INSTANCE has NOT got a class_name attribute, we see if its CLASS, namely Goblin, possesses this class_name attribute. Clearly this holds, and so goblin.class_name = "goblin" Read comment of @Martin Cura Seems as if __init__ RUNS right after the instance goblin got created. Hence        
(7): def __init__(self, name): self.name = name GameObject.objects[self.class_name] = self Take self = goblin, and so self.class_name = goblin.class_name = "goblin". Also, GameObject.objects = {} is a (empty) dictionary. GameObject.objects["goblin"] = goblin ??? So hard to understand this. Feel free to reply back to this comment as for what this code actually DOES to the GameObject.objects = {} (empty) dictionary. I personally THINK what happens is that a new element gets added to the GameObject.objects={} dictionary which has its Key: Value as equal to "goblin": goblin. See the following code perhaps to help you. F_dic = {} print(F_dic) F_dic["huri"] = 7 print(F_dic) print(F_dic["huri"]) OUTPUT: >>> {} {'huri': 7} 7 >>>
(8): So now I guess GameObject.objects={"goblin": goblin} Going back, we were trying to see what gets RETURNED by examine("goblin"), since we had print(examine("goblin")). def examine("goblin"): if "goblin" in GameObject.objects: return GameObject.objects["goblin"].get_desc Clearly, in the dictionary GameObject.objects = {"goblin": goblin}, the string "goblin" certainly EXISTS as a Key. So, examine("goblin") would RETURN whatever is given by the following. GameObject.objects["goblin"].get_desc goblin.get_desc
(9): Now, consider the definition is the get_desc method. goblin.class_name + "\n" + goblin.desc "goblin" + "\n" + "A foul creature" "goblin A foul creature" Hence, examine("goblin") would RETURN this ☝ 2 line string, and so print(examine("goblin")) would OUTPUT the 2 lines ☝ (without the quotation marks of course). Clearly, this certainly occurred as we can see.
