# SECTION 1
# Object-orientation is very useful when managing different objects and their relations. 
# That is especially useful when you are developing games with different characters and features.

# Let's look at an example project that shows how classes are used in game development.
# The game to be developed is an old fashioned text-based adventure game.
# Below is the function handling input and simple parsing.
def get_input():
  command = input(": ").split()
  verb_word = command[0]
  if verb_word in verb_dict:
    verb = verb_dict[verb_word]
  else:
    print("Unknown verb {}". format(verb_word))
    return

  if len(command) >= 2:
    noun_word = command[1]
    print (verb(noun_word))
  else:
    print(verb("nothing"))

def say(noun):
  return 'You said "{}"'.format(noun)

verb_dict = {
  "say": say,
}

while True:
  get_input()
#

# The code above takes input from the user, and tries to match the first word with a command in verb_dict. 
# If a match is found, the corresponding function is called.

# (1): def get_input(): command = input(": ").split() verb_word = command[0] if verb_word in verb_dict: verb = verb_dict[verb_word] else: print("Unknown verb {}".format(verb_word)) return if len(command) >= 2: noun_word = command[1] print(verb(noun_word)) else: print(verb("nothing")) def say(noun): return 'You said "{}"'.format(noun) verb_dict = { "say": say, } while True: get_input() OUTPUT: >>> : say Hello! You said "Hello!" : say Goodbye! You said "Goodbye!" :test Unknown verb test
# (2): Thanks to the reply of Jonathon McEwan to the question comment of Egildio Nham, I luckily managed to figure out that the verb_dict is a dictionary that's DEFINED towards the BOTTOM of the code!!! What a pain - I was reading the code from top to bottom, that's why, so got confused ðŸ˜”. 
Admittedly, with this whole OOP module, reading code from bottom to top instead can awkwardly help a lot sometimes. Last code block of the example code is the following. while True: get_input() The while True bit indicates that there will NEVER ever be an END to the repeated execution of the code get_input(). An infinite loop I think this gets called. That's why trying the code out, you would be REPEATEDLY prompted for user input really. Hence why in the OUTPUT that's shown, though there's ">>>" at the beginning of the OUTPUT, it's not there at the end, since there's no actual end to the infinite loop, it goes on FOREVER.
# (3): Now, let's go through what you see in the OUTPUT they've got there. 
Program starts up, and aside from the bunch of 2 function definitions, the dictionary assignment of verb_dict, 
you've got the following code which is what causes something to ultimately be OUTPUT. while True: get_input() 
So, the code (the function I mean) get_input() gets executed. 
Now, consider how this get_input() function is DEFINED. def get_input(): command = input(": ").split() 
  User gets prompted to enter input right after ": " on the OUTPUT screen. User enters say Hello!, and so input(": ") is taken as the string "say Hello!". 
  So, I presume the following interpretations
# (4): command = input(": ").split() command = "say Hello!".split() 
Now, plz see the PIC on the following link to quickly remind yourself of the split method, and what it means to have nothing inside the parenthesis () of split(). 
https://pythonproject.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/split_method.jpg 
  Hence, command variable is assigned to be equal to a LIST of 2 strings. That's it. command = ["say", "Hello!"] Then, you've got the following. verb_word = command[0] So, verb_word variable is assigned to be equal to the index 0 element of the list called command, which is the string "say". Therefore,
# (5): verb_word = "say" Look at the BOTTOM of the example code now. See how verb_dict = {"say": say}, so verb_dict really refers to a dictionary, with just a single element really, namely the Key:Value element given by "say": say. OK, next consider the following code line, which gets interpreted presumably as follows. if verb_word in verb_dict: verb = verb_dict[verb_word] if "say" in {"say": say}: verb = verb_dict[verb_word] Of course, "say" refers to the Key "say", since in a dictionary, though the there may be one or more Values being the EXACT SAME Values, all Keys MUST be DISTINCT, and because of this, we identify any specific element of a dictionary by its Key.
# (6): The key "say" certainly exists in the dictionary {"say": say}, so really the first line of the 2 line code block becomes "if True:", and so the 2nd line of code gets executed for sure. verb = verb_dict[verb_word] We know verb_dict={"say": say} and that verb_word = "say", hence verb = say Also, recall that command=["say", "Hello!"]. Clearly, this has got 2 elements and so has a length of 2. Thus, len(command) = 2. if len(command) >= 2: noun_word = command[1] print(verb(noun_word))          
# (7): Since, len(command) â‰¥ 2 holds True, the 2 lines indented code block is surely executed. I suppose the following interpretations get made. Remember command[1] refers to the index 1 element of the LIST assigned to command, and that verb = say noun_word = command[1] print(verb(noun_word)) noun_word = "Hello!" print(say("Hello!")) This is just saying that apply the function say on the string "Hello!", and then whatever gets RETURNED by the function, that you print right away. So, now you look at the way the say function is DEFINED, which you find if you look at what come after the definition of the get_input() function.
# (8): def say(noun): return 'You said "{}"'.format(noun) I think the following interpretations get made. say("Hello!") RETURN 'You said "{}"'.format("Hello!") say("Hello!") RETURN 'You said "Hello!"' So, print(say("Hello!")) would print You said "Hello!" to OUTPUT
# https://pythonproject.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/split_method.jpg   # reminder regarding the SPLIT method

# There are a few things that I didn't quite much get... 
# First thing is: print(verb(noun_word)) verb is a variable... not a function ! But even if it was... 
# how does this work ? I am really confused ! Second thing is: def say(noun): return 'You said "{}"'.format(noun) 

# The code takes the user input: say hello And using split makes it an array consisting of 'say' and 'hello' both assigned to the variable 'command' 
# command = ["say","hello"] verb_dict is referring to a dictionary declared near the bottom. 
# The key value pair here is Key: say Value: say(noun) Which is assigned to the variable verb noun_word=command[1] 
# So when print(verb(noun_word)) is called its acctually calling say("hello")
