# Examples:
print(100//42) # 2
print(20/7)    # 2.8571
print(20//7)   # 2


# Example: to produce code that output 10 raised to the 5th power
print(10**5)

# pow Examples:
# pow(x,y)  # x - the figure which is raised. 
            # y - the figure which raises. 
            # Their outputs are equal to each other. 
print(pow(10,5))    # 100000 
print(10 ** 2)      # 100
print(pow(9,1/2))   # 3.0 
print(9 ** (1/2))   # 3.0
