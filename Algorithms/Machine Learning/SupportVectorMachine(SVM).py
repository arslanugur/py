'''
It is a classification method. 
In the algorithm, we plot each data item 
as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is number of features you have) 
with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate.
For example, if we only had two features like Height and Hair length of an individual, 
weâ€™d first plot these two variables in two dimensional space 
where each point has two co-ordinates (these co-ordinates are known as Support Vectors)

#import Library
from sklearn import svm
#Assumed u have, X (predictor) and Y (target) for
#training data set and x_test(predictor) of test_dataset
#Create SVM classificaton object
model = svm.svc()
#there are various options associated with it, this is simple for classification.
#Train the model using the training sets and check
#score
model.fit(x, y)
model.score(x, y)
#Predict Output
predicted = model.predict(x_test)
