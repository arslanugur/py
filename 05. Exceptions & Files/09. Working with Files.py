# Good practice to avoid wasting resources by making sure that files are always closed after they have been used. 
# One way of doing this is to use try and finally
try:
   f = open("filename.txt")

   print(f.read())

finally:
   f.close()
# 

# This ensures that the file is always closed, even if an error occurs.

# Finally block won't work properly if FileNotFoundError occurred. 
# So, we can make another try~except block in finally: 
# Example:
try: 
  f = open("filename.txt") 
  print(f.read()) e
  except FileNotFoundError: 
    print("No such file or directory") 
finally: 
try: 
  f.close() 
except: 
  print("Can't close file") 
# Or we can force our program to open our py file. 
# Like this: 
try: 
  f = open("filename.txt") 
  print(f.read()) 
except FileNotFoundError: 
  print("No such file or directory") 
  f = open(__file__, "r") # open itself 
finally: 
  f.close() 
# In other cases when we catch FileNotFoundError f.close() makes error too (and program will stop). 
# Note: second variant is faster, IMHO, because it didn't using one more try~except block.


# Example: The close() function will get called in this code
try:
  f = open("filename.txt")
  print(f.read())
  print(1 / 0)
finally:      # Remember that: finally: is always called, regardless of exceptions or errors. Since f.close() is within finally:, it will be called
  f.close()

# Example:
try: f = open("nonexistent.txt") 
  print(f.read()) 
except FileNotFoundError: 
  print("No such file or directory") 
finally: 

try: 
  f.close() 
except: 
  print("Can't close file") 
  print('duck')
  
try: 
  f = open("nonexistent.txt") 
  print(f.read()) 
finally: 
  f.close() 
  print('duckduck')
# The code would move on, in this example, even if the file doesn't exist, it still prints "duck", 
# but after the second part, if the file doesn't exist, the program terminates and doesn't print "duckduck". 
# And "open(__file__)" opens your current ".py" file, 
# because it will always exist, as itself long as you are running the program from a ".py" file, 
# since if it the code runs, it means the file exists.


# The following is a standard way to manage exception handling when opening and reading a file. 
# Notice the nesting of exception handling to cater for closing an already open file. 
try: # ... to open file. 
  myFile = open("sample.txt") 
try: # ... to read file. 
  print(file.read()) 
except: # ... handle read errors. 
  raise 
finally: # ... close my open file. 
  myFile.close() 
except: # ... handle open and read errors. 


# Example:
try: 
  f = open("file", "w") 
try: 
  f.write('Hello World!') 
finally: 
  f.close() 
except: 
  print('Wrong')
# A much cleaner way of doing this is using the with statement: 
# try: with open("output", "w") as outfile: outfile.write('Hello World') except: print 'Wrong'



# Example: This is the code for book title 
file = open("/usercode/files/books.txt", "r") 
for i in file: 
  if i[-1]=="\n": 
    print(i[0]+str(len(i)-1))
  else:
    print(i[0]+str(len(i))) 
file.close()


# Example: A more effective method is using the 'with' operator. 
with open('example.txt', 'r') 
as f: print(f.read())
# This simple 2-liner opens your file and only keeps it open while the code inside the 'with' statement is running then closes it. 
# To break it down: 
with open('example', 'r') 
as f: # - with - ensures the file is only open while we are working with it. 
open('example.txt', 'r') # opens 'example.txt' in read-only mode
as f # assigns a variable to open('example.txt', 'r'). - Equivalent to f = open('example.txt', 'r') : - 
# Required for syntax purposes print(f.read()) - prints(f.read())
# prints the content of the file we opened earlier under the f variable Note: This WILL NOT catch errors



# Heres what I came up with for the book titles problem. 
file = open("/usercode/files/books.txt", "r") 
books = file.readlines() # makes a list containing each line from books.txt as a list item. 
for book in books: 
  letter = (book[0]) # this variable stores the first letter (index 0) of each book 
  if book == books[-1]: # index -1 of the "books" list will look at the last item in "books" this way, if someone added more books to books.txt, our code will still work. 
    length = str(len(book)) # store the number of characters. Since this is for the last item in books, it will not have "\n" at the end so we can store the length as is. 
                            # We also changed it to a string so that we can add it to our "letter" variable in the next step. 
    print(letter + length) 
  else: 
    length = str(len(book)-1) # this subtracts 1 from every book that isn't the last on the list. This corrects the lengths that have the "\n" on the end. 
    print(letter + length)
    file.close()
