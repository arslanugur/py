# Boolean logic is used to make more complicated conditions for if statements that rely on more than one condition.
# Python's Boolean operators are and, or, not.
# The and operator takes two arguments, and evaluates as True if, and only if, both of its arguments are True. Otherwise, it evaluates to False. 
print(1 == 1 and 2 == 2)  # True
print(1 == 1 and 2 == 3)  # False
print(1 != 1 and 2 == 2)  # False
print(2 < 1 and 3 > 6)    # False

# Boolean operators can be used in expression as many times as needed.
