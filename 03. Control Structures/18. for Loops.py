# The for loop is used to iterate over a given sequence, such as lists or strings.
# The code below outputs each item in the list and adds an exclamation mark at the end:
movies = ["Interstellar", "Inception", "Prestige", "Tenet"]
for movie in movies:
    print(movie + " by Nolan!")
# output:
Interstellar by Nolan!
Inception by Nolan!
Prestige by Nolan!
Tenet by Nolan!

# In the code above, the word variable represents the corresponding item of the list in each iteration of the loop.
# During the 1st iteration, word is equal to "hello", and during the 2nd iteration it's equal to "world", and so on.


# Example:
test = [5,3,4,2] 
counter = 0 
max_range = len(test)-1 
while counter <= max_range: 
    test[counter]+= 2 
    counter += 1 
    print(test)
# output:
# [7, 3, 4, 2]
# [7, 5, 4, 2]
# [7, 5, 6, 2]
# [7, 5, 6, 4]

# to create a valid for loop.
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
for l in letters:
  print(l)
# output:
# a
# b
# c
  
# Example:
numbers=['20', '22', '26'] 
for n in numbers: 
    print(n) # Output: 20 22 26  
  

# The for loop can be used to iterate over strings.
# For example:   
str = "testing for loops"
count = 0

for x in str:
   if(x == 't'):
    count += 1

print(count) # 2

# The code above defines a count variable, iterates over the string and calculates the count of 't' letters in it. 
# During each iteration, the x variable represents the current letter of the string.
# The count variable is incremented each time the letter 't' is found, 
# thus, at the end of the loop it represents the number of 't' letters in the string. 

# Similar to while loops, the break and continue statements can be used in for loops, to stop the loop or jump to the next iteration.

# for those wondering how For first t, count +=1 So count = 0+1 = 1 For second t, count +=1 So count = 1+1 = 2 So the output is 2

# Example:
list = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
for x in list:
    if(x%2==1 and x>4):     # This statement means if the variable x modulus 2 is 1 and variable x is greater than 4 
        print(x)
        break
# output: 5

# Explaination:
# x%2 means that after x is divided by 2 there is a remainder of 1. 
# the "AND" in the if condition means that both parts have to be satisfied, 
# so we can automatically exclude 2, 3, and 4 since they are <= 4 not >4 That leaves 5, 6, and 7 
# Since the for loop works from left to right in the list, let's start with 5 5/2 is 2 remainder 1, 
# so 5%2 =1 and 5>4 so it satisfies the if condition, so the answer is 5! 
# Because of the 'break', even though 7 also fits the if condition, it will not be printed.



# FOR versus WHILE
# Both, for and while loops can be used to execute a block of code for multiple times.
# Loops: The construct can be used to iterate through a list

# It is common to use the for loop when the number of iterations is fixed. 
# For example, iterating over a fixed list of items in a shopping list.

# The while loop is used in cases when the number of iterations is not known and depends on some calculations and conditions in the code block of the loop.
# For example, ending the loop when the user enters a specific input in a calculator program. 

# Both, for and while loops can be used to achieve the same results, 
# however, the for loop has cleaner and shorter syntax, making it a better choice in most cases.

# Example:
words=["Hello","world","spam","eggs"] 
a=0 
b=len(words)-1  # 4 - 1 = 3 
while a<=b: 
    c=words[a] 
    print(c+"!") 
    a=a+1

# Second Way
words = ["hello", "world", "spam", "eggs"]     # 1. words = list with 4 elements
counter = 0                        # 2.
max_index = len(words) - 1         # 3.
while counter <= max_index:     
    word = words[counter]          # 4.     
    print(word + "!")     
    counter = counter + 1          # 5. add 1 to counter, next time through, counter will be item 1 in the list

    
# Third Way
words = ["hello", "world", "spam", "eggs"]

for i in range(0,len(words) ):
    print (words[i] + "!")

# Shorter Way
words = ["hello", "world", "spam", "eggs"]

for i in words:
    print(i + "!")

    
    
# Example:
x=[1,2,3,4,5] 
y=0 
while y<len(x): 
    print(x[y]) 
    y+=1    # 12345


# Example:
# Manipulating a view ;)
# I would say that this is useful for the ones having problems with loops.
