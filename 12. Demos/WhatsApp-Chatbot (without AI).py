Currently there are only 24 if-conditions.

Although, it’s useless as you’d need to do a lot of changes in the code to make it work. 
You would need to adjust coordinates and install some of those libraries too.

Explanation :

When executed, it simply

    Opens WhatsApp Web,
    Opens the concerned person’s chat,
    And after every second, selects the very last message,
    And replies if any ‘if’ condition is satisfied.

That’s it.
