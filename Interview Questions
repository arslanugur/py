# Problem: Meta and Microsoft Interview
# Question: An encoded string (s) is given, the task is to decode it.
#           The pattern in which the strings were encoded were as follows
#           original string: abbbababbbababbbab
#           encoded string: 3[a3[b]1[ab]]
# Example:
# Input: s = 3[b2[ca]]
# Output: bcacabcacabcaca  
# Explanation: 2[ca] means 'ca' is repeated twice which is 'caca' which concatenated with 'b' becomes 'bcaca'.
#              This string repeated thrice becomes the output 


# Problem: Amazon Interview Challenge
# Given an array, X, of N integers, calculate and print the respective mean, median, and mode on separate lines.
# If your array contains more than one modal value, choose the numerically smallest one.
n=6
x=[1,2,3,4,5,5]
# the mean is 20/6 = 3.3
# the median is (3+4)/2 = 3.5
# the mode is 5 because 5 occurs most frequently
# Complexity: try to do it in O(N) time



# Problem: Amazon Interview Challenge
# You are given N dice, each having m faces(from 1 to m)
# Find probability of getting sum of the numbers on dice as X assuming all the dice are thrown together exactly once.
# (n <= <= m * n)
n=3
m=6
x=8
# answer 5/36
# Expected time complexity: O(n*x)
# Bonus: Try to extend the solution for finding probabilities for getting sum >=x and <x as well
