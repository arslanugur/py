Quiz 2.1 - Introduction to Regression Models Quiz
In the expression Sales â‰ˆ f(TV, Radio, Newspaper), "Sales" is the: Response
The variable which you are trying to model is called the response or outcome. 
The other variables are called features, predictors, or independent variables. 
Together, the collection of features and response values that you will use for fitting form your training data.

Quiz 2.2 - Dimensionality and Structured Models Quiz
A hypercube with side length 1 in d dimensions is defined to be the set of points (x1, x2, ..., xd) such that 0 <= x_j <= 1 for all j = 1, 2, ..., d. 
The boundary of the hypercube is defined to be the set of all points such that there exists a j for which 0 <= x_j <= 0.05 or 0.95 <= x_j <= 1 (namely, the boundary is the set of all points that have at least one dimension in the most extreme 10% of possible values). 
What proportion of the points in a hypercube of dimension 50 are in the boundary? 
(hint: you may want to calculate the volume of the non-boundary region)
Please give your answer as a value between 0 and 1 with 3 significant digits. If you think the answer is 50.52%, you should say 0.505:
The volume of the interior of the hypercube is 0.950 = 0.005. Thus, the volume of the boundary is 1-0.005 = 0.995.
