# THE RULES OF SLICING
# List Slicing --> [start:stop:increment/decrement]
#                  [start: end: stepsize]
#        print(list[start:stop:step]) 
#        1. If (start<=stop and step is negative, in result is[] . 
#        2. If (start>=stop and step is positive, in result is []. 

# List slices provide a more advanced way of retrieving values from a list. 
# Basic list slicing involves indexing a list with two colon-separated integers. 
# This returns a new list containing all the values in the old list between the indices.
# Example:
squares = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
print(squares[2:6])       # [4, 9, 16, 25]
print(squares[3:8])       # [9, 16, 25, 36, 49]
print(squares[0:1])       # [0]

# Like the arguments to range, the first index provided in a slice is included in the result, but the second isn't.


# Tip: To reverse the whole list use mylist[::-1] 
# Example:
mylist = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(mylist[::-1])   # [4, 3, 2, 1] 
# The slicing of a list takes three arguments separated by colon. they are optional. 
# lower limit:upper limit: steps by default (if you don't specify) 
# lower limit is at index 0, upper limit is at the last value and steps is +1 
# so using ::-1 as in the example means don't slice anything off but give in reverse order. 


# STRINGS are essentially LISTS (or TUPLES to be more precise) in Python.
strn = "There can be only one"  # input 
print(strn[::-1])               # output: eno ylno eb nac erehT


# A nice little trick for dealing with ranges that are inclusive of the first value 
# but exclusive of last is to do the last minus the initial to know how many elements are in the range. 
# Example:
squares = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
print(squares[2:6])       # [4, 9, 16, 25]           6 - 2 = 4 
print(squares[3:8])       # [9, 16, 25, 36, 49]      8 - 3 = 5 
print(squares[0:1])       # [0]                      1 - 0 = 1 
# When you print the range you end up with [4, 9, 16, 25] which is 4 elements, [9, 16, 25, 36, 49] is 5 and [0] is 1. 
# This is a nice little trick when you're trying to trace code and figure out the output or something.



# Worth adding here as a reminder is that when you create a list and assign it to a variable, 
# you have to think of this variable as POINTING to the list rather than being EQUAL to it. 
# Whenever you assign another variable to the one you already have assigned the list, both variables point to THE SAME list object. 
# Any list modifications will affect ALL variables pointing to it. 
# Example: 
squares = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81] 
quadras = squares 
squares[9] = 100 
print(quadras) # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 100]



# Example: List Slicing
squares = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81] 
print(squares[2:6])           # [4, 9, 16, 25] 
print(squares[3:8])           # [9, 16, 25, 36, 49] 
print(squares[0:1])           # [0]
print(squares[::-1])          # [81, 64, 49, 36, 25, 16, 9, 4, 1, 0]
print(squares[::2])           # [0, 4, 16, 36, 64]  
print(squares[::-2])          # [81, 49, 25, 9, 1]
print(squares[3:9:2])         # [9, 25, 49]
print(squares[7:1:-1])        # [49, 36, 25, 16, 9, 4]
print(squares[1:8:3])         # [1, 16, 49] 





# Example:
my_list = [0, 1, 2, "skip", 6, 7, 8, 9] 
# you want to fill in the missing numbers in the sequence. 
# Your first attempt might be:
my_list[3] = [3, 4, 5] 
# But this would make the value of my_list be [0, 1, 2, [3, 4, 5], 6, 7, 8, 9], and that list in the middle of a list would cause problems. 
# But using the following list slice: my_list[3:4] = [3, 4, 5] 
# Now the value of my list is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], which is what we originally wanted! 
# you could use list slices that way at the following website:
# http://rightfootin.blogspot.com/2006/09/more-on-python-flatten.html


# You can also pass a value to a variable and then use that variable for list slicing. 
# Example: 
list = ["a","b","c"]
d = 0
e = 2
list_new = list[d:e]
print(list_new) # ['a', 'b']


# Example:
sqs = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64]
print(sqs[4:7])         # [16, 25, 36]


# Sample:
x = first index 
y = second index
print(list[x:y])  # prints from index x to index y - 1



# If the first number in a slice is omitted, it is taken to be the start of the list.
# If the second number is omitted, it is taken to be the end.
# Example:
squares = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
print(squares[:7])     # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]
print(squares[7:])     # [49, 64, 81]
# Slicing can also be done on tuples.

# Notice the colon before and after the 7 
# Before - means count all before 7 
# After - means count all after 7


# If you use any number biggger than last key, still the result is same
print(squares[7:100]) # [49,64,81]
print(squares[7:])    # [49,64,81]
# Also negatives work just fine till the second key dosn't cross the first key to the left: 
print(squares[7:-1])  # [49,64]
print(squares[7:-5])  # []



# Examples: Clone Arrays with [:]
    # A safe way to clone two arrays.
    # I know a method exists but this seems
    # like a shorter way.

arr_a = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
arr_b = arr_a

print("Before Change:")
print(arr_a)
print(arr_b)

print("\nAfter arr_b[0] is assigned to 2:")
arr_b[0] = 2
print("arr_a: %s" % arr_a)
print("arr_b: %s" % arr_b)
print("# Both are changed.")

print("\nA safe way to clone array using [:]:")
arr_b = arr_a[:]
print("arr_b = arr_a[:]: %s" % arr_b)
arr_b[1] = 2
print("arr_b[1] = 2: %s" % arr_b)
print("arr_a is not affected: %s" % arr_a)


# Example: To take the first two elements of the list:
list = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
a = list[0:2]         # [:2]  # slices don't display the last number. [0:1] will display a only. [0:2] will display a,b
                              # [0:2] means [first index: last index -1] and we get 0,1 if we need "abc" then list[0:3] = 0,1,2
                              # it's 0:2 Because the CUT its before to the two
                              # for example, you need the first 2 elements and
                              # You have list = ["0", "1", "2", "3"] list[0:2] list = [/"0", "1", /"2", "3"] / Its the cut
#


# List slices can also have a third number, representing the step, to include only alternate values in the slice. 
# Example:
squares = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
print(squares[::2])         # [0, 4, 16, 36, 64]
print(squares[2:8:3])       # [4, 25]
# [2:8:3] will include elements starting from the 2nd index up to the 8th with a step of 3.




# The structure is: print(squares[start, stop, step]) 
# Example:
# squares = [1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 2, 5, 11, 12] 
# The index of the first element in an array is 0 and the index of the last element is numberOfElementsIntheArray-1. 
# In our case, 1 has the index 0, and 12 has the index 8. 
# The first element in our array is 1. 
# 1 -> index = 0 
# 2 -> index = 5 
# 3 -> index = 1
# 4 -> index = 2 
# 5 -> index = 6 
# 7 -> index = 3
# 9 -> index = 4
# 11 -> index = 7
# 12 -> index = 8  
# print(squares[2:6:2]) 
# start : 2 ; stop : 6 ; step : 2 output:[4, 9] 
# Steps: 
# 1) 1st element is 4 ( index = 2 ) 
# 2) 2nd element is 9 ( index = 4 -> 2(index of the last element)+2(step)=4 ) 
# 3) the next element should have the index 6 ( index = 6 -> 4+2=6 ), but the last possible element is the element with the index = stop-1. 
# In our case stop is 6, so the last possible element should have the index 5. 
# It's like in math...an interval [2,6), but we talk about indexes. 6 notâˆˆ [2,6) 
# Another example: print(squares[2:8:1] output : [4, 7, 9, 2, 5, 11]


squares = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81] 
print(squares[2:8:3])
print(squares[2:8])   # Firstly print(squares[2:8]) gives output (4,9,16,25,36,49)
                      # Then (:3) means (+3rd) elements in result starting from first i.e.(4,25).. 
                      # Similarly [2:8:2] will give output (4,16,36){(+2nd) elements in result,starting from first}

# print(squares[2:8:3]) - 2 is the starting point,8 is the ending point,3 means that every third element from the first before ,so first,2 squares =4(first one),
# then select the third element from the 2(which is 5 (2+3)) , 5 squares is 25, 
# and now we cant get anymore (because 5+3=8(which is the ending point) and the final output will be [4,25]


# Example:
list = [ "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine", "Ten" ] 
print(list[::1])          # [ "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine", "Ten" ] 
print(list[::2])          # [ "One", "Three", "Five", "Seven", "Nine" ]
print(list[::3])          # [ "One", "Four", "Seven", "Ten" ]
# formula: index = element_index + step example: list[ : 10 : 3 ] start = 0 finish = 10 step = 3 index = 0 + 3 = 3 index = 3 + 3 = 6 index = 6 + 3 = 9

# It will take steps wherever it can, by the multiple of the step number. 
# For example: 
squares = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81] 
print(squares[0:10:2])    # [0, 4, 16, 36, 64] 
# This will print from the first number to the last number but "steps over" every second number (the step number is 2) 
# It won't print 81 because it isn't a multiple of 2 in the list index (it's 9). It also won't print the 10th number because it doesn't exist.

# You can also take a step to backward 
sqs = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81] 
print(sqs[7:1:-2]) # [49, 25, 9]



# Example:
sqs = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
print(sqs[1::4])                          # [1, 25, 81]


# [begining :last :interval] 
# where 
# -'begining' is the first value we take 
# -'last' is the last value which is not included 
# -'interval' is a number that will send back,from begining to last, every value in its interval. 
# Example: 
list = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6] 
print(list[::2]) # prints every 2 values


# Example:
sqs = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81] 
index=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] 
print(sqs[1::4]) 
# In this question [ start : stop : jump ] 
# sqs[ 1 : : 4 ] means as per index it starts - index[1] = 1 jump(4) - index[5] = 25 jump(4) - index[9] = 81


# SECTION: NEGATIVE SLICE
# Negative values can be used in list slicing (and normal list indexing). 
# When negative values are used for the first and second values in a slice (or a normal index), they count from the end of the list. 
squares = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
print(squares[1:-1])                            # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64]

# If a negative value is used for the step, the slice is done backwards.
# Using [::-1] as a slice is a common and idiomatic way to reverse a list.

# Worth noting is that STRINGS are esentially LISTS in Python, so: 
# Example: 
strn = "There can be only one"
print (strn[::-1])  # output: eno ylno eb nac erehT

# Example:
squares = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81] 
print(squares[1:-1])                            # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64]
print(squares[1:-2])                            # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49]
print(squares[1:-3])                            # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]
print(squares[1:-4])                            # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
print(squares[1:-5])                            # [1, 4, 9, 16]


# Example:
squares = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81] 
print(squares[:])   # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81] 
print(squares[:2])  # [0, 1] 
print(squares[:3])  # [0, 1, 4] 
print(squares[:-1]) # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64] 
print(squares[:-2]) # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49] 
print(squares[:-3]) # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36] 


# Example:
list = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] 
slice= list([A:B:C]) 
# C should be added to "index A" until it reaches "index B". 
# But for negetive numbers you need to pay attention to the equivalent positive index (eg: indx -1 = indx 9) 
# for positive A and B If A<B then C must be positive If A>B then C must be negetive
# for negetive A and B If A<B then C must be positive If A>B then C must be negetive
# when A and B are not of the same sign you have to look at the index which they refer to. 
# Then decide about the sign of the C.
# Eg1. Slice= List([1:-2:C]) 1 refers to number 1 -2 refers to number 8 of index 8 
# So moving from index 1 to index 8 requires a positive C 
# Eg2. Slice= List([8:-3:C]) 8 refers to number 8 -3 refers to number 7 of index 7 
# So moving from index 8 to index 7 requires a negetive C 


# [:1:-1]   -- -1 from last

# Example:
squares = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81] 
print(squares[7:1:-1]) # print(square[start from 7th index: end at 1 : every 1 step backward])              # output: [49, 36, 25, 16, 9, 4]
# The end(1 index) would not include in the slice. 
print(squares[7:1:-2]) # print(square[start from 7th index: end at 1 : every 2 step backward])              # output: [49, 25, 9]
# The end(1 index) would not include in the output, and the (2 index) not include in the output because of that every -2 steps.

# Example:
sqs = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
print(sqs[7:5:-1])                          # [49, 36]
# Here we have a negative step (-1) - we'll get the elements in reversed order. 
# So, starting backward (from highest to lowest element's index), 
# we make the first slice before index 7, 
# and then the other - before index 5: list 
# sqs = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81] 
# index  0  1  2  3   4   5 Â¦ 6   7 Â¦ 8   9 slices 2nd 1st 
# And we'll get 2 elements between the slices in reversed order: [49, 36]
    

# We need to start the slicing from index 7 and then continue till index 5 in step of 1. 
# The index count will always be from the beginning. 
# Note that we can go in the reverse direction because the step is -1. 
# Below results will further explain what I am trying to say. 
sqs = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81] 
print(sqs[7:6:-1])                          # [49] 
print(sqs[7:4:-1])                          # [49, 36, 25]
print(sqs[7:3:-1])                          # [49, 36, 25, 16]
print(sqs[7:2:-1])                          # [49, 36, 25, 16, 9]
print(sqs[7:1:-1])                          # [49, 36, 25, 16, 9, 4]

print(square[2:6])                          # Here we make one slice before index 2, and then another - before index 6: 
# list [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81] 
# index 0  1Â¦ 2  3   4   5 Â¦ 6   7   8   9 slices 1st 2nd 
# So we'll get 4 elements between the slices: [4, 9, 16, 25]


# When working with indices, always consider the cursor point. 
# Say we have list = [0,1,4,9,16,25,36,49,81]. 
# If we have to slice list[:4], we can visualize it with the cursor point. 
# Consider 'll' is the cursor point and it is placed at the beginning of each element, like : [ll0, 1, 4, 9, ll16, 25, 36, 49, 81]. 
# So to slice, we can move from the 1st cursor point to the 2nd and collect everything in between which would yield [0,1,4,9] in this case. 
# If negative step is used, then we can just place the cursor point at the end of each element like [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25ll, 36, 49ll, 81] 
# and to slice list[7:5:-1], we can move from the 2nd cursor point to the 1st and collect everything in between in reverse order, which would yield [49, 36] in this case.


# Example:
lista = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] 
print(lista[:-3])   # output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] --> Creates a list with 3 elements except the end 
print(lista[::-3])  # output: [9, 6, 3, 0]          --> Creates a reverse list of 3 on 3 starting from the end


# Example:
# Range start = 9 Range end = 0 Count 1 
sqs = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
print(sqs[9:0:-1])  # output: [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1] 
# Range start = 9 Range end = 5 Count = 1
sqs = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
print(sqs[10:5:-1]) # output: [9, 8, 7, 6] 
# If you put -2 will give this output 
# Range start = 9 Range end = 0 Count = 2 
sqs = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
print(sqs[10:0:-2]) # [9, 7, 5, 3, 1]



# Examples:
# Why the first index of a list was included and the second was excluded. 
# Realised that this allows a nice way to recompose the full list: 
mylist = [0,1,2,3]
part1 = [:2]
part2 = [2:]
print(part1 + part2) # [0,1,2,3]


# make list 
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, -3] 
print(nums[::-1])       # [-3, 4, 3, 2, 1] 
# make tuple 
nums = (0, 2, 3, 4, -3) 
print(nums[::-1])       # (-3, 4, 3, 2, 0) 


# When the second number in a slice is omitted, it is taken to be the "end", but the last index is included in the slice. 
# At the other hand, if you write the second number as the last index number, then that index gets excluded from the slice.


# So, I'm getting confused a bit with list ranges. 
# If I have a list with 5 elements (0-4), and I use this notation, 
# then I'd I use list(2:4) it will actually omit the last element. 
# If I did list(2:5) I should get index error. 
# But if I do list(2:) 
# I'd actually get all elements from index 2 up to and including the last element.

I noticed there are still quite a few questions on this comment thread. 
Here are some examples I created that helped me understand how slice interacts with list squares = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81] 
#slice used to return the beginning of the range to the index #before the 7th index in the list print(squares[:7]) print() 
#slice used to return from the 7th index to end of the range in the list. print(squares[7:]) print() 
#Using Slice to return an empty sequence. print(squares[10::]) print() 
#using slice to return a sequence of the complete list print(squares[::]) print() 
#using slice to return a sequence of the list backwards #note: this doesn't reverse the list in place like 
#the list.reverse() function would. print(squares[::-1]) print() 
#using slice in steps(offset) to start at the beginning of the list 
#and go right by 2 print(squares[::2]) print() 
#using slice in steps(offset) to start at the end and go left by 2 print(squares[::-2])




Everyone check this out : Serie_A = [['Juventus', 90],['Inter', 88],['Atalanta', 83],['Lazio', 79],['AsRoma', 71],['Napoli', 65],['AcMilan', 61]] 
Champion = Serie_A[:1]
Champions_League = Serie_A[:3]
Cl_Playoffs = Serie_A[4:5]
Europa=Serie_A[6:]
Print(Champion) 
#Champions of Italy Print (Champions_League) 
#Realm of champions Print (Cl_Playoffs) 
#Almost there Print (Europa) 
#Make Italia great again
