# TEXT ANALYZER
# SECTION 1
# This is an example project, showing a program that analyzes a sample file to find what percentage of the text each character occupies.
# This section shows how a file could be open and read.
# Code:
filename = input("Enter a filename: ")
with open(filename) as f:
   text = f.read()
print(text)
"""
Result:
Enter a filename: test.txt

# Example: to read the contents of a file using the "with" statement.
with open(filename) as f:
   text = f.read()
#

# They used the "with" function, meaning that there is no need to close the file. 
# But the problem it is that we have stored everything into a variable 
# and if we don't wan't to use memory, it will be better to delete the variable after using it. 
# We can always reopen the file if we need it. 
# If we want just to print what it is inside the file, a better option is: with open(filename) as f: print(f.read())

# Why in this case there is no 'r'ead after the filename? 
# what if I don't write the , 'r' (or 'w' or 'wb') using 'with'.
# what's the default (if any) with open("filename", 'r') as f:


# SECTION 2
# This part of the program shows a function that counts how many times a character occurs in a string.
def count_char(text, char):
  count = 0
  for c in text:
    if c == char:
      count += 1
  return count
#
# This function takes as its arguments the text of the file and one character, returning the number of times that character appears in the text.
# Now we can call it for our file.
filename = input("Enter a filename: ")
with open(filename) as f:
  text = f.read()
#
print(count_char(text, "r"))

# Output:
# Enter a fileneme: test.txt
# 83                       # The character "r" appears 83 times in the file.
