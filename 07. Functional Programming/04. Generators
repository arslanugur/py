Generators are a type of iterable, like lists or tuples.
Unlike lists, they don't allow indexing with arbitrary indices, but they can still be iterated through with for loops.
They can be created using functions and the yield statement.
Example:
def countdown():
    i=5
    while i > 0:
        yield i
        i -= 1

for i in countdown():
    print(i)          # 5,4,3,2,1
#

# The yield statement is used to define a generator, replacing the return of a function to provide a result to its caller without destroying local variables.
