# REUSING CODE
# Code reuse is a very important part of programming in any language. Increasing code size makes it harder to maintain.
# For a large programming project to be successful, 
# it is essential to abide by the Don't Repeat Yourself, or DRY (easier to Maintain), principle doing of doing this: by using loops. 
# In this module: functions and modules.
# Repetitive code is said to abide by the WET principle, which stands for Write Everything Twice, or We Enjoy Typing.

# Already used functions in previous subjects.
# Any statement that consists of a word followed by information in parentheses is a function call.
# Examples:
print("Hello world!")
range(2, 20)
str(12)
range(10, 20, 3)

# The words in front of the parentheses are function names, 
# The comma-separated values inside the parentheses are function arguments.
