# Arguments
  # All the function definitions we've looked at so far have been functions of zero arguments, which are called with empty parentheses.
  # However, most functions take arguments.
  # The example below defines a function that takes one argument:
#
def print_with_exclamation(word): # the argument is defined inside the parentheses.
   print(word + "!")
    
print_with_exclamation("exclamation")
print_with_exclamation("explaination")
print_with_exclamation("examination")
