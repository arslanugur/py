# Intro
# About Python collection types, lambda functions, generators, decorators, OOP, and much more.
# To build real-world projects and solve several programming challenges. 

      #Code:
n = [2, 4, 6, 8]
res = 1
for x in n[1:3]:   # n[1:3] means n is equal to 4,6 
  res *= x         # res*=x means res=res*x

print(res)         # output: 24

# The loop runs for first time and take the value of x as 4
# So,the value of res changed to 1*4=4 .And secondly x=6
# So, the value of res will be 4*6=24. Lastly res=24
