# Multiple Variables

# You can use multiple variables to take multiple inputs for your program.
# For example, the following code takes two inputs and stores them in the variables x and y:
x = input()
y = input()

# Task:
# Given the code above, output the input x repeated y times.

# Sample Input:

# 3

# Sample Output:
# awesomeawesomeawesome

# Code:
x = input()
y = int(input())
print(x * y)
