# Basic Concepts of Python to run the code you have to enter your name age and again your name 

print('Hello world!') # Basic Python

print(2 + 3) # Addition

print(10 - 5) # Subtraction

print(3 * 5) # Multiplication

print(10 / 2) # Division

print(10 / 3) # Created a float by dividing 10 and 3

print(10 + 1.2) # Adding 10 to 1.2 which is a "float"

print(9**2) # Exponetiation

print(10 // 2) # Quotient 

print(20 % 3) # Remainder

print("we are learning python") #string

print("jolly joker\'s card") #we use the backslash (\) in this sentence

print("one \ntwo \nthree") #we use \n to represent a new line 

print("""we
are
learning
python""") #we can even use the triple quotation to represent words in differnt lines 

print("we \tare \tcoders") #the \t is used to create a space between strings

print(" we " + " are " + " coders ") #concatination is when we add 2 or more strings

print("2" + "3") #we can even convert integers into strings by putting them into double quotation

print(" python " * 3) #we can even multiply strings by integers

x = 10
print(10) #variables are represented by using the = sign
    
print(x + 5) #variables can also be added
    
python = 14
aarav = 15
del coders
print(python) #we use the (del) statement to delete something if we print(python + coders) it would have shown an error as aarav has been deleted 

name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(name) #to ask the user something, we use the input statement

age = int(input())
print(age) #we use the int statement to covert a string into a integer

name = input()
print(" hello " + name) #we can even add a string and concatinate it with the input

x = 5
x += 10
print(x) #in place operators are used to simplify the code 

x = "coders"
x += " python "
print(x) #in palce operators can also be used to add strings
