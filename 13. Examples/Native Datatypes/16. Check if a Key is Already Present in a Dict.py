# Native Datatypes Examples
# Example: to Check if a Key is Already Present in a Dictionary

# Example:
# Using in keyword
my_dict = {1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c'}

if 2 in my_dict:
    print("present")    # Output: present

# Using if statement and in keyword, you can check if a key is present in a dictionary.
# In the above example, 2 is present in the dictionary as a key; therefore, the output is present.
# You can use not in if you want to check if a key is not present in the dictionary.
