# Introduction Examples
# Example: to swap two variables by using a temporary variable and, without using temporary variable.
# Topics: Python Input, Output and Import, Python Data Types, Python Operators


# Source Code: Using a temporary variable
# Python program to swap two variables
x = 5
y = 10

# To take inputs from the user
# x = input('Enter value of x: ')
# y = input('Enter value of y: ')

# create a temporary variable and swap the values
temp = x
x = y
y = temp

print('The value of x after swapping: {}'.format(x))
print('The value of y after swapping: {}'.format(y))

# Output:
# The value of x after swapping: 10
# The value of y after swapping: 5

# In this program, we use the temp variable to hold the value of x temporarily. 
# We then put the value of y in x and later temp in y. 
# In this way, the values get exchanged.




# Source Code: Without Using Temporary Variable
# In Python, there is a simple construct to swap variables. 
# The following code does the same as above but without the use of any temporary variable.
x = 5
y = 10

x, y = y, x
print("x =", x)
print("y =", y)

# If the variables are both numbers, we can use arithmetic operations to do the same. It might not look intuitive at first sight. 
# But if you think about it, it is pretty easy to figure it out. Here are a few examples

# Addition and Subtraction
x = x + y
y = x - y
x = x - y


# Multiplication and Division
x = x * y
y = x / y
x = x / y


# XOR swap
# This algorithm works for integers only
x = x ^ y
y = x ^ y
x = x ^ y
