# Decision Making and Loops Examples
# Example: Find the Factorial of a Number

# The factorial of a number is the product of all the integers from 1 to that number.
# For example, the factorial of 6 is 1*2*3*4*5*6 = 720. 
# Factorial is not defined for negative numbers, and the factorial of zero is one, 0! = 1.

# Example: Factorial of a Number using Loop
# Python program to find the factorial of a number provided by the user.

# change the value for a different result
num = 7

# To take input from the user
#num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

factorial = 1

# check if the number is negative, positive or zero
if num < 0:
   print("Sorry, factorial does not exist for negative numbers")
elif num == 0:
   print("The factorial of 0 is 1")
else:
   for i in range(1,num + 1):
       factorial = factorial*i
   print("The factorial of",num,"is",factorial)
#
# Output:
# The factorial of 7 is 5040

# Note: To test the program for a different number, change the value of num.
# Here, the number whose factorial is to be found is stored in num, 
# and we check if the number is negative, zero or positive using if...elif...else statement. 
# If the number is positive, we use for loop and range() function to calculate the factorial.

# 
# iteration				factorial*i (returned value)
# i = 1           1 * 1 = 1
# i = 2           1 * 2 = 2
# i = 3   				2 * 3 = 6
# i = 4   				6 * 4 = 24
# i = 5     			24 * 5 = 120
# i = 6   				120 * 6 = 720
# i = 7   				720 * 7 = 5040




# Example: Factorial of a Number using Recursion
# Python program to find the factorial of a number provided by the user
# using recursion
def factorial(x):
    """This is a recursive function
    to find the factorial of an integer"""

    if x == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        # recursive call to the function
        return (x * factorial(x-1))


# change the value for a different result
num = 7

# to take input from the user
# num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# call the factorial function
result = factorial(num)
print("The factorial of", num, "is", result)

# In the above example, factorial() is a recursive function that calls itself. 
# Here, the function will recursively call itself by decreasing the value of the x.
