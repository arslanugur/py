# Example: Kilometers to Miles
# To convert kilometers to miles and display it.

# Taking kilometers input from the user
kilometers = float(input("Enter value in kilometers: "))

conv_fac = 0.621371 # conversion factor

# calculate miles
miles = kilometers * conv_fac
print('%0.2f kilometers is equal to %0.2f miles' %(kilometers,miles))

# Output
# Enter value in kilometers: 3.5
# 3.50 kilometers is equal to 2.17 miles

# Here, the user is asked to enter kilometers. This value is stored in the kilometers variable.
# Since 1 kilometer is equal to 0.621371 miles, we can get the equivalent miles by multiplying kilometers with this factor.
# Your turn: Modify the above program to convert miles to kilometers using the following formula and run it.
# kilometers = miles / conv_fac
